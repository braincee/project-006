               These sources provide information on file signatures, also known as magic numbers or 
               Magic Bytes, which are used to identify or verify the content of a file. However, they 
               do not provide a direct solution to convert a signature to HEX format. You may need to
                use a specific tool or library to achieve this conversion.
